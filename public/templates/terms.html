                    cryptochat.dev website ("Website" or "Service") and any of
                    its related products and services (collectively,
                    "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding between you
                    ("User", "you" or "your") and this Website operator
                    ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using

                    which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to
                    such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do
                    not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not
                    accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Website

                    contract between you and the Operator, even though it is
                    electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it
                    governs your use of the Website and Services. This terms and
