CryptoChat is a simple, secure and beautiful chat webapp. Chatting has never been so satisfying.

## Features

Here's an overview of the features CryptoChat has to offer.

### Simple UI

CryptoChat has barely any clutter on its user interface. It's a simple, yet featured, interface that anybody could use--even your grandma!

### Encryption

All messages sent through the official CryptoChat clients are end-to-end encrypted locally, meaning nobody except for the message recipients can read their contents. 

### Ephemeral

Message history is *never* stored when using CryptoChat clients. Not on the server, not on the client, not anywhere. When the browser tab goes, so does the chat history.

### Cross-Compatible

Since CryptoChat uses web frameworks, all you need is an electronic device with a web browser. Whether the device is a smartphone, tablet, game console or desktop computer, you can take CryptoChat with you everywhere.

### Open-Source

CryptoChat is open-source meaning that anybody can see its interworkings. This allows the community to improve on its codebase and spot potential security vulnerabilities, leading to an awesome product.

## Encryption

CryptoChat relies on the crypto-js AES encryption framework to encrypt all usernames and messages with the specified encryption/room key.
