CryptoChat is a simple, secure and beautiful chat webapp. Chatting has never been so satisfying.

## Features

Here's an overview of the features CryptoChat has to offer.

### Simple UI

CryptoChat has barely any clutter on its user interface. It's a simple, yet featured, interface that anybody could use--even your grandma!

### Encryption

All messages sent through the official CryptoChat clients are end-to-end encrypted locally, meaning nobody except for the message recipients can read their contents. If you need more piece of mind during your chats, use the random key generator for an extra-secure key (it would take 3,505 years to crack!).

### Ephemeral

Message history is *never* stored when using CryptoChat clients. Not on the server, not on the client, not anywhere. When the browser tab goes, so does the chat history.

### Cross-Compatible

Since CryptoChat uses web frameworks, all you need is an electronic device with a web browser. Whether the device is a smartphone, tablet, game console or desktop computer, you can take CryptoChat with you everywhere.

### Open-Source

CryptoChat is open-source meaning that anybody can see its interworkings. This allows the community to improve on its codebase and spot potential security vulnerabilities, leading to an awesome product.

## Encryption

CryptoChat relies on the crypto-js AES encryption framework to encrypt all usernames and messages with the specified encryption/room key. More specifically, all data sent over the Internet is encrypted using AES-256 bit keys.
